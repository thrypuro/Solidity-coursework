* What is it?
Coursework and report of a university course at University of Edinburgh.

* First coursework
A simple multiplier dice game where two players gamble a couple of eth, where there is 50-50 chance for each player to win. For example, if the dice rolls 1-3 Player A wins, if 4-6 rolls then Player B wins.

While this game is quite easy to implement in conventional programming languages, the concept of randomness is hard to implement in Solidity.

Hence, a commitment scheme is implemented. Read the pdf for info.


* Second coursework
Had to make my own token, that could be mint but only by a owner. Although it would be better to just do the conventional ERC20 way to implement a ethereum token.

This is purely a educational to learn about how tokens are implemented.
